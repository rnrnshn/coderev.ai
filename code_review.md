### **File: `index.ts`**

**Summary of Changes:**
The `index.ts` file has been updated to include imports for `generateCommitMessageTool` and `writeReviewToMarkdownTool`, and these tools are now registered within the `streamText` configuration, making them available to the AI agent.

**Feedback:**
*   **Correctness:** The additions are straightforward and correctly integrate the new tools into the agent's capabilities. This is a necessary step for enabling the agent to use these new functionalities.
*   **Clarity:** The change is clear and directly reflects the intention of expanding the agent's toolset.

### **File: `tools.ts`**

**Summary of Changes:**
This file introduces two new tools:
1.  **`generateCommitMessageTool`**: A tool designed to generate a commit message based on the staged Git changes in a given directory. It supports different styles (conventional, simple, detailed).
2.  **`writeReviewToMarkdownTool`**: A tool to write provided review content into a markdown file, including a title, timestamp, and a disclaimer.

**Feedback:**

#### **1. `generateCommitMessageTool`**

*   **Correctness & Logic:**
    *   The use of `zod` for input schema validation (`commitMessageSchema`) is excellent, ensuring type safety and clear expectations for tool inputs.
    *   The initial check for `!stagedFiles.trim()` is a good safeguard to prevent generating messages for an empty staging area.
    *   The `excludeFiles` array is a thoughtful addition to filter out irrelevant files (e.g., build artifacts, lock files) from the change summary.
    *   The logic for different commit message `style` options (conventional, simple, detailed) is well-defined and provides useful flexibility.
        *   **Suggestion (Conventional Commit Style):** The `conventional` style currently categorizes changes quite broadly (`feat`, `refactor`, `chore`). For a more robust conventional commit message, consider a more granular analysis that could detect `fix:` (bug fixes), `docs:` (documentation changes), `perf:` (performance improvements), etc. This might involve looking at keyword patterns in the diffs or requiring specific commit message inputs from the user if the analysis is too complex. This is a trade-off between simplicity and comprehensive conventional commit adherence.
    *   The inclusion of file names for `changes.length <= 3` is a nice touch for clarity, but for the `conventional` style, it might be better integrated into the body of the commit message rather than appending it directly to the subject line.

*   **Maintainability:**
    *   The tool is well-structured, separating schema definition from the execution logic, which aids readability and future modifications.

*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Suggestion (Error Handling):** While `simple-git` handles many scenarios, consider adding more explicit error handling around the `git.diffSummary()` and `git.diff()` calls. For instance, if `rootDir` is not a valid Git repository, these commands might throw an error. Catching such exceptions could provide more user-friendly feedback than a generic runtime error.

#### **2. `writeReviewToMarkdownTool`**

*   **Correctness:**
    *   The markdown formatting for the review output is clear and professional, including a title, timestamp, and a clear disclaimer about AI generation.
    *   The use of `writeFileSync` with UTF-8 encoding is appropriate for standard text output.
*   **Clarity & Maintainability:**
    *   The tool's purpose is very clear, and its implementation is straightforward.
    *   Again, `zod` for `markdownReviewSchema` is a strong practice.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   The `try-catch` block around `writeFileSync` is excellent for gracefully handling potential file system errors and providing informative messages.

*   **Nitpick (Unused Import):** The `join` function from the `path` module is imported but not used within the provided `tools.ts` diff. While harmless, it's good practice to remove unused imports to keep the code clean.

---

**Overall Impression:**
These changes are a significant improvement, adding valuable functionality to the agent. The code is generally clean, follows good practices like schema validation, and shows attention to detail in areas like error handling for file operations. The suggestions provided are primarily for minor enhancements or considerations for future robustness and feature expansion rather than critical issues.
