### **`tools.ts`**

This file introduces significant new functionality related to performance analysis. The new tools (`analyzeFilePerformance`, `analyzeDirectoryPerformance`, `analyzeAlgorithmComplexity`) are central to the agent's enhanced capabilities, and their own efficiency is crucial.

#### **Function: `analyzeFilePerformance`**

This function attempts to identify various performance anti-patterns and memory leak risks within a given file.

**Performance Insights & Suggestions:**

1.  **Regex Efficiency**:
    *   **Observation**: Multiple regex patterns are defined and then used within `forEach` loops (`performancePatterns.forEach`, `memoryLeakPatterns.forEach`). Each `content.match(pattern)` operation will re-scan the entire file content.
    *   **Potential Bottleneck**: For large files, repeatedly scanning the `content` string with multiple regex patterns can be computationally expensive (O(N * M) where N is file size and M is number of patterns, or worse depending on regex complexity).
    *   **Suggestion**: If the patterns were very complex, compiling regexes once outside the loop could offer a minor improvement, but the primary cost is the `match` operation itself. A more advanced approach for very large files might involve a single pass parsing, but for typical code file sizes, the current approach is acceptable, though it's important to be aware of the `match` cost.
    *   **Algorithm Complexity**: Each `content.match(pattern)` has a time complexity related to the length of the content and the complexity of the regex pattern. If there are `P` patterns, the combined complexity for this section is approximately `P * O(length(content) * avg_pattern_complexity)`.

2.  **`complexityKeywords` for Cyclomatic Complexity**:
    *   **Observation**: The cyclomatic complexity is calculated by iterating over `complexityKeywords` and matching each keyword against the entire file content.
    *   **Potential Bottleneck**: Similar to the regex patterns, this involves multiple scans of the file content.
    *   **Suggestion**: This is a reasonable heuristic for cyclomatic complexity. For more precise (and possibly more performant) analysis on larger codebases, consider integrating a dedicated AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parser, which would allow for a single pass to build the AST and then traverse it to calculate complexity. However, for a simple heuristic, the current approach is acceptable for individual files.

3.  **Large Function Detection**:
    *   **Observation**: The code matches for `function \s*\w+\([^)]*\)\s*\{[^}]*\}` globally and then iterates through each matched function to count lines.
    *   **Potential Bottleneck**: The initial regex match itself can be expensive for very large files with many functions.
    *   **Suggestion**: The line counting for each function is `O(function_length)`. This is generally acceptable.

4.  **Nested Loops Detection**:
    *   **Observation**: Uses a regex `/for\s*\([^}]*\{[^}]*for\s*\([^}]*\{/g` to detect nested `for` loops.
    *   **Algorithm Complexity**: This is a regex search which is efficient for this specific pattern but might miss other forms of nested loops (e.g., `while` inside `for`, or deeply nested loops).
    *   **Suggestion**: This is a good heuristic, but a more robust check would involve AST parsing to accurately identify all forms of nested control structures.

5.  **Performance Score Calculation**:
    *   **Observation**: The `performanceScore` is decremented based on the `severity` and `matches.length`.
    *   **Clarity/Maintainability**: The arbitrary `severity` values (1-4) and fixed decrements (e.g., `-5` for large functions, `-10` for nested loops) are somewhat magic numbers.
    *   **Suggestion**: While functional, consider making the scoring more configurable or explaining the rationale for each decrement in comments for future maintainability.

#### **Function: `analyzeDirectoryPerformance`**

This tool scans a directory and analyzes files within it using `analyzeFilePerformance`.

**Performance Insights & Suggestions:**

1.  **Recursive Directory Scanning (`scanDirectory`)**:
    *   **Observation**: The `scanDirectory` function uses `readdirSync` and `statSync` which are synchronous I/O operations.
    *   **Potential Bottleneck**: Synchronous I/O can block the event loop in Node.js/Bun, leading to reduced responsiveness, especially for large directories with many files and subdirectories. While the agent operates in an isolated environment, blocking the thread is generally an anti-pattern for performance-sensitive applications.
    *   **Suggestion**:
        *   **Primary Recommendation**: Change `readdirSync` and `statSync` to their asynchronous counterparts: `fs.promises.readdir` and `fs.promises.stat`.
        *   **Optimization**: Instead of a recursive `scanDirectory`, consider using a non-blocking, iterative approach (e.g., a queue-based breadth-first search) if the call stack limit for deep directories becomes an issue.
        *   **Current Complexity**: The `scanDirectory` function itself has a complexity proportional to the number of files and directories in the tree (`O(N_files + N_dirs)`).

2.  **Sequential File Analysis**:
    *   **Observation**: The `for (const file of files)` loop calls `await analyzeFilePerformance({ filePath: file })` sequentially.
    *   **Potential Bottleneck**: If `analyzeFilePerformance` is I/O bound (which it is due to `readFileSync`) or CPU-bound, processing files one by one will be slow for many files.
    *   **Suggestion**:
        *   **Concurrency**: Use `Promise.all` or `Promise.allSettled` with a concurrency limit (e.g., 5-10 files at a time) to process multiple files in parallel. This will significantly speed up directory analysis, especially on multi-core machines. Example: `await Promise.allSettled(files.map(file => analyzeFilePerformance({ filePath: file })));`
        *   **Error Handling**: If using `Promise.all`, ensure robust error handling for individual file analyses so that one failed file doesn't stop the entire directory scan. `Promise.allSettled` is good for this as it returns results for all promises, whether fulfilled or rejected.

3.  **Excluding Files**:
    *   **Observation**: The `excludeFiles` array is used to skip `dist` and `bun.lock`.
    *   **Improvement**: This is a good practice to avoid analyzing irrelevant or generated files, which improves performance by reducing the workload.

#### **Function: `analyzeAlgorithmComplexity`**

This tool attempts to estimate the time and space complexity of a code snippet.

**Performance Insights & Suggestions:**

1.  **Regex for Complexity Estimation**:
    *   **Observation**: The function relies heavily on regex matches (`forLoops`, `whileLoops`, `nestedPattern`, `recursivePattern`, `expensiveOps`) to infer complexity.
    *   **Limitations & Accuracy**: Regex is a limited tool for static analysis of algorithmic complexity. It can identify patterns like explicit `for` loops or `sort()` calls, but it struggles with:
        *   Data-dependent loops (e.g., loops iterating up to a variable `n` that isn't clearly `array.length`).
        *   Implicit complexities (e.g., a function call that itself contains a loop, or a library function with non-obvious complexity).
        *   Recursive functions where the number of calls depends on input size.
        *   Exact space complexity, as it's hard to track variable allocations.
    *   **Potential for False Positives/Negatives**: A simple `for` loop might not always be `O(n)` if `n` is a constant. Nested loops are flagged as `O(nÂ²)`, which is a good heuristic, but could be higher if deeply nested.
    *   **Suggestion**:
        *   **Acknowledge Limitations**: Clearly state in the tool's documentation that this is an *estimation* based on common patterns and not a rigorous mathematical proof of complexity.
        *   **Refinement (Advanced)**: For more accurate complexity analysis, an AST-based approach would be necessary. This involves parsing the code into its structural components and then traversing the tree to identify control flow and data access patterns. This is significantly more complex to implement but yields far more precise results. For a simpler agent, the current regex-based approach is a reasonable heuristic.
        *   **Algorithm Complexity**: Each regex search is `O(length(codeSnippet) * pattern_complexity)`. The sum of these operations determines the overall complexity of *this analysis tool itself*.

2.  **`complexityScore` Calculation**:
    *   **Observation**: Similar to `analyzeFilePerformance`, fixed decrements are used.
    *   **Clarity**: The scoring mechanism is a heuristic.
    *   **Suggestion**: This is acceptable for a scoring mechanism, but acknowledging its heuristic nature is good.

#### **Overall `tools.ts` Review:**

*   **Positive**: The introduction of these tools significantly enhances the agent's capability by adding performance analysis. The approach of using regex to detect common patterns is a pragmatic starting point for a static analysis tool. The structure is clear, and the issues/recommendations are well-formatted.
*   **Key Performance Improvement Opportunity**: The most impactful performance improvement would be to address the synchronous I/O and sequential processing in `analyzeDirectoryPerformance` by introducing asynchronous I/O and concurrency.
*   **Accuracy vs. Simplicity Trade-off**: The current implementation prioritizes simplicity by using regex. This is a valid design choice for a rapid prototype or initial version, but it comes with limitations in accuracy and robustness compared to AST-based analysis. This trade-off should be understood.

### **`index.ts`**

This file updates the agent to include the new performance analysis tools.

**Performance Insights & Suggestions:**

1.  **Tool Registration**:
    *   **Observation**: The new performance tools (`analyzeFilePerformanceTool`, `analyzeDirectoryPerformanceTool`, `analyzeAlgorithmComplexityTool`) are imported and registered with the `streamText` function.
    *   **Impact**: Registering more tools increases the surface area for the AI model to choose from. While this doesn't directly impact the *runtime performance of `index.ts` itself*, it means the AI has more options, which could lead to more nuanced (and potentially more complex/longer) interactions, indirectly affecting the "performance" of the AI's response time or token usage.
    *   **Suggestion**: None specific for `index.ts` beyond acknowledging the new capabilities. The `stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)` is a good guard to prevent excessively long tool-use chains.

2.  **Prompt Change**:
    *   **Observation**: The `codeReviewAgent` prompt is updated to explicitly request a focus on performance analysis.
    *   **Impact**: This is crucial for guiding the AI to use the newly implemented performance tools.

### **`README.md`**

The `README.md` has been updated to reflect the new features and focus on performance analysis.

**Performance Insights & Suggestions:**

*   **Observation**: The `README.md` clearly highlights "Performance Analysis" as a primary focus, detailing the types of issues detected (bottlenecks, memory leaks, algorithm complexity) and optimization opportunities.
*   **Impact**: This is excellent documentation and communicates the value proposition of the new features. No performance issues in the `README` itself.

---

### **`prompts.ts`**

The `SYSTEM_PROMPT` has been significantly expanded to define the AI's new persona as a "performance analyst" and to detail the "Performance Analysis" focus areas.

**Performance Insights & Suggestions:**

*   **Observation**: The prompt now explicitly guides the AI on what to look for regarding performance (algorithm efficiency, memory management, bottlenecks, optimization, resource management).
*   **Impact**: This change is critical for the AI to effectively leverage the new performance analysis tools and provide relevant feedback. It doesn't have direct performance implications for the prompt file itself, but it dictates the *quality and depth* of the performance review the agent will provide.

### **`package.json`**

No functional changes beyond potential reformatting.

**Performance Insights & Suggestions:**

*   **Observation**: No new dependencies were added in the provided diff for `package.json`.
*   **Impact**: This implies no new runtime overhead from external libraries being introduced by these specific changes. If new dependencies *were* added (e.g., an AST parser), their size and potential runtime impact would be a factor to consider.

### **Summary of Key Performance Takeaways and Recommendations**

The changes significantly enhance the agent's capabilities by integrating powerful performance analysis tools. The most crucial area for optimization lies within the `tools.ts` file, particularly the `analyzeDirectoryPerformance` function.

**Top Recommendations for Performance Improvement:**

1.  **Asynchronous I/O for Directory Scanning**: Modify `analyzeDirectoryPerformance` to use asynchronous file system operations (`fs.promises.readdir`, `fs.promises.stat`) to prevent blocking the event loop.
2.  **Concurrent File Analysis**: Implement concurrency (e.g., using `Promise.allSettled` with a limited pool) in `analyzeDirectoryPerformance` to process multiple files in parallel, drastically speeding up directory scans.
3.  **Acknowledge Complexity Tool Limitations**: Clearly document that `analyzeAlgorithmComplexity` provides *estimations* based on common patterns rather than rigorous mathematical proofs, due to its regex-based approach.

Overall, this is a strong set of changes that significantly improve the agent's value proposition by adding a much-needed focus on performance. Addressing the synchronous I/O and sequential processing bottlenecks in `analyzeDirectoryPerformance` will further solidify these improvements.
